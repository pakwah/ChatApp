# ChatApp

A simple direct message chat application. Created under the supervision of [Tommy Meisel](https://github.com/thomasameisel).

## Installation

Download the correct version of MongoDB for your operating system from [here](https://www.mongodb.org/downloads#production) and perform any initial setup (you may have to set up a folder for all of the data to be stored in). `cd` into the main application directory and run `npm install`, followed by `npm start`. Now direct your browser to `localhost:3000`. To stop the application, simply use `ctrl-c`; this will stop the server, database, and front-end translation.
